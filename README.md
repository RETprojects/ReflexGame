# ReflexGame ⏱️
This is a Python reaction time-testing game (still in development) designed for the Thumby miniature game system (http://thumby.us/).

## Rules
In this game, the objective is to press the A button on your Thumby as soon as you see the appropriate shape. At the beginning of the game, after you press the down button, you will be told to look out for either a circle, a triangle, or a square. After pressing the up button to start the game, you will see a black screen. Every once in a while, a shape will randomly pop up. Your reaction time will only be recorded if you press the A button for the correct shape. If you see the correct shape pop up, press the A button to break out of the gameplay loop. Your reaction time (in milliseconds) will then by displayed.
